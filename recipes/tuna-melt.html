    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is dedicated to all those chefs who tell you to never, ever mix fish and cheese together; and yet there they are, at the diner at 2:00 in the morning. And you know what they eat? Tuna melts. And the reason they do is because it is delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6.5 ounce) jar oil-packed tuna, drained</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced green onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely diced celery</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons capers, drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Asian chile paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons softened butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 thick slices French bread</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Place tuna into a mixing bowl and lightly break apart with a fork. Add green onion, celery, capers, chile paste, and mayonnaise. Pinch small pieces from mozzarella cheese into the tuna salad and stir to mix. Season with salt and black pepper; refrigerate tuna salad until needed.</li>
        <li>Heat oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Spread butter generously on both sides of French bread slices.</li>
        <li>Broil buttered bread until golden brown on top, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip bread slices and broil other side until toasted, 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove from oven and turn bread slices over on the baking sheet so the darkest sides are on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Gently spread tuna salad onto bread slices using 2 forks. Press the salad onto the bread and spread tuna all the way to the edges of the bread. Spread shredded sharp Cheddar over each sandwich. Dust tops with cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Place sandwiches under broiler and cook until cheese is melted and bubbling, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
